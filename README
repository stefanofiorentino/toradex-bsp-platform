Toradex oe-core Setup
=====================

To simplify installation we provide a repo manifest which manages the different
git repositories and the used versions.
(more on repo: https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/ )

Install the repo bootstrap binary:

  mkdir ~/bin
  PATH=~/bin:$PATH
  curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
  chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Create a directory for your oe-core setup to live in and clone the meta
information. Check the http://git.toradex.com/toradex-bsp-platform.git
for available branches.

  mkdir oe-core
  cd oe-core
  repo init -u http://git.toradex.com/toradex-bsp-platform.git -b <branch>
  repo sync

Optionally create a development branch in all git repositories

  repo start mybranch --all

Source the file 'export' to setup the environment. On first invocation this
also copies a sample configuration to build/conf/*.conf.

  . export

Adapt build/conf/local.conf to your needs. At least check the variables
DL_DIR and MACHINE. Set MACHINE to a preferred value and/or override it
from the command line.

Check conf/local.conf for a list of machines for Toradex modules.

e.g. set in local.conf

  MACHINE ?= "colibri-imx6"

and then if you want to build for Apalis iMX6 instead, use the following
command line:

  MACHINE=apalis-imx6 bitbake angstrom-lxde-image
